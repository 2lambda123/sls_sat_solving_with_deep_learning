# GNN-based oracle factories for SLS solvers.

This is the code to accmpany the submission "Using deep learning to construct Stochastic Local Search SAT solvers with performance bounds". 

## Setup


1. Create new conda environment
2. Install all requirements
3. Compile the rust code
4. (optional) run tests

## Usage

To replicate the experiments, you can either take the trained models or rerun the training. 

To use the existing models, simply run the tutorial notebook. 

To train, run the "run all experiments" config file, and then point the tutorial to those model files saved in there.
