# SLS based SAT solving with deep learning and performance bounds.

This is the code to accompany the submission "Using deep learning to construct Stochastic Local Search SAT solvers with performance bounds". 

## Setup
**0. Clone the repository**

Clone the repository via

`
git clone <repo>
`

and navigate to the repository using

`
cd <repo>
`

**1. Create virtual environment and install all the requirements in the virtual environment**

This app has been run and tested with Python 3.10. To start with, ensure you have a version of Python3.10 installed locally. To install virtualenv type

`
pip3.10 install virtualenv
`

Run

`
virtualenv venv
`
or 
`
python3.10 -m virtualenv venv
`

to create a new virtual environment environment and activate it by typing

`
source venv/bin/activate
`

Now we can install the requirements in the current environment. To do so, type

`
pip install -r requirements.txt
`

Note that if you want to use a GPU for training, you should run

`
pip install "jax[cuda]" -f https://storage.googleapis.com/jax-releases/jax_cuda_releases.html
`

afterwards to install the GPU version of Jax. If you use a TPU, use the following command:

`
pip install "jax[tpu]" -f https://storage.googleapis.com/jax-releases/libtpu_releases.html
`


**2. Compile the rust code**

The MT algorithm and WalkSAT are implemented in Rust (we used rustc version 1.66.0) because of performance reasons. Start by installing Rust via rustup by typing

`
curl --proto '=https' --tlsv1.2 -sSf https://sh.rustup.rs | sh
`

and run

`
maturin develop -r
`

If you experience problems with the compilation process, check the compiler version (using `rustc -V`) and try downgrading (`rustup install 1.66`).

**3. (optional) run tests**

There are dedicated test files for the code. To run them, type

`
pytest
`

## Usage

### Files from document

The plots from the experiments can be found under `Data/plots`, the pre-trained models


### Run GNN-boosted SLS solvers


### Using existing model

To replicate the experiments, you can either **take the trained models or rerun the training**. 

1. To **use the existing models**, simply run the tutorial notebook. 

### Using retrained models

1. Run the "run_all_experiments" config file by typing 

`
 chmod +x run_all_experiments.sh 
`

and then

`
./run_all_experiments.sh 
`

2. Point the tutorial notebook to those model files saved in there (by default, the model files will be stored under "experiments/params_save"). You can do this in the first cell of the tutorial notebook. 

### Generating datasets

We provide the dataset used for the experiments reported in the submission alongside the code. However, to genereate new datasets, use the notebook  `python/src/instace_sampling.ipynb`.
